Task a: (animatedEmoji.py)
(1) Give three pictures, named as 'spider', 'deadpool' and'volleyball'.
(2) In function 'start', it will display three pictures on the LED screen at intervals of 3 seconds. 
(3) Call the function ‘start’ to start the program

Task b: (monitorAndDisplay.py)
(1)Read the config.json file, and format the content to JSON format.
(2)Check the content of config.json is valid or not, 
   such as attributes is acceptable or not, and values is number or not,
   and return some possible errors if loading unsuccessfully
(3)Create a 'run' function. It need temperature detected by the temperature sensor 
   and the pressure sensor of pi averaged and retain two decimal places. 
   Display the numbers on the LED, and call 'show_temp' function to display result.
(4)In function 'show_temp', 
   When temp <= 10℃, it will display with blue colour. 
   When temp is between 10 to 25℃, it will display with green colour.
   When temp >= 25℃, it will display with blue colour.
(5)Call the function 'run' to start the program and update every 10 seconds.

Task c: (Dice.py, electonicDie.py, game.py)

Dice.py
(1)Setup the threshold for shaking as 1
(2)In function 'roll', This function is to get the number from 1 to 6 randomly, 
   and show 6 different dice pictures, and also return the number.
(3)In function 'go_dice',it obtain the speed sensor of pi twice to get the parameters of x, y, z axis. 
   If the number of new parameter minus the old parameter is greater that threshold,
   it means that the remote sensing is successful.
(4)Then call the function 'go_dice'

electronicDie.py(for c1)
(1)Create sense and show message 'Shake'.
(2)Create 'run' function. Define 'is_next' to True, and start counting time, 
   and if is_next is true, which means that it should get dice number, it will call dice.go_dice method.
   Then set is_next to False, which means that it should not call roll, until 1 seconds later.
(3)One seconds later, it sets is_next to True, and allow to roll again.
(4)Call function 'run' to start the program.

game.py(for c2)
(1)It will preload the winner.csv file and check whether it is exist
(3)Call function 'show_instructions' to show the instruction.
(4)Define variables for both player1 and player2.
(5)Roll the dice and take turns, and the scores will be recorded.
(6)If anyone gets 30 points, the game is over.
(7)Show the result (p1 or p2 or Tie) on the LED screen. 
   When score_player1 >= 30 > score_player2 OR score_player1 > score_player2 >= 30  is P1 win
   When score_player1 < 30 <= score_player2 OR  30 <= score_player1 < score_player2 is P2 win
   When 30 <= score_player1 = score_player2, and the result is Tie.
(8)In function 'save_the_result', it will record current_time, winner, score_player1 and score_player2 in the winner.csv.
(9)Call function 'run' to start the game.
